# KNN vs. KMC vs. NB

## Project Description
Compare K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means Clustering, and Naive Bayes machine
learning algorithms on the same dataset.

## Models
* KNN
* K-Means Clustering
* Naive Bayes

## What To Expect
1. There will be comments displayed on the Command Window as the code runs
2. The following graphs will be displayed in order:
    * KNN 2D
    * KNN 2D Test Data and True Labels
    * KMC 2D (5 Iterations)
    * KMC 2D Test Data and True Labels
    * NB 2D
    * NB 2D Test Data and True Labels
    * KNN 3D
    * KNN 3D Test Data and True Labels
    * KMC 3D
    * KMC 3D Test Data and True Labels
    * NB 3D
    * NB 3D Test Data and True Labels
